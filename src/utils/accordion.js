Some NFTs are 'just' digital art and have value for a collector or art enthusiast, others offer additional utility like exclusive access to merch or participation in an event in which case the NFT will also act as a “members” card."

        content: <>Here is how you will be able to buy a Cata on pre-sale and public mint. <br/> <br/>
            1. Create a <strong><a className="ct_ext_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://metamask.io/download.html">Metamask wallet</a></strong>. This is the extension you will need to purchase Catas, and this is where your cryptocurrency and your NFT will be stored. This is just like a real-life wallet, but it is used for NFTs and cryptocurrency.
            <br/><br/>
            2. Buy cryptocurrency to mint your Catas. For Catas, we use the cryptocurrency called Ethereum (abreviated ETH). You can buy cryptocurrency on different platforms, just like <strong><a className="ct_ext_link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.binance.com/">Binance</a></strong> or <strong><a className="ct_ext_link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a></strong>. After you have verified your account, buy the amount of ETH you need for your Catas.
            <br/><br/>
            On top of that, in order to purchase a Cata, you will need to pay gas fees. Gas fees are a sort of tax that you need to pay to use the Ethereum network.
            <br/><br/>
            3. Transfer your newly purchased Ethereum to your Metamask wallet. There is a good FAQ page on how to do that here (<strong><a rel="noreferrer" className="ct_ext_link" target="_blank" href="https://metamask.io/faqs">faqs</a></strong>).
            <br/><br/>
            4. When the sale starts go on our website and click on the "Mint" button. This will open Metamask, and you will need to confirm the transaction.</>
